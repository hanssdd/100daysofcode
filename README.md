# 100daysofcode
Documenting the projects I'm doing as I embark on my 100 days of code journey.

Hi, I don't really know who would be reading this, but feel free to look around if you'd like :)
I've always been coding on and off and I want to finally hold myself accountable to consistenly learn to code so... here we are!

Cheers
HS
