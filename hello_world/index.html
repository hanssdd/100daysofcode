            <p>Howdy world (3rd hello now for this webspage! I guess third time's the charm eh?).
                <br>
                I'm HS, and this website is my very first html/css project for my course on Codecademy (check it out!)
                If you're wondering why I decided to take this course, the following reasons may answer your questions (if you even have any LOLz)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I want a career change, going to tech</li>
                <li>Practicing to be a good software developer</li>
                <li>Because I want to xD</li>
            </ul>
